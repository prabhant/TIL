Model Signatures:
* Model signatures are Input, Output specs and params for a saved model. 
* It can help to inspect models better and integrate them into engineering pipiline and avoid errors
* For example M_1 with parameteres P_1 requires a set of input D_1 and -> O_1, this can be generalised and be better for CI/CD and writing tests in general.
